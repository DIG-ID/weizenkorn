## [1.1.2] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- Home page template with ordered, ACF-driven sections (hero, products, USP band, services, gastronomy, locations, work & training, about teaser) and reusable `section-heading` / `card` / `usp-item` components.
- Responsive 12/6/2 column grid (`.theme-container` / `.theme-grid`) and a DM Sans typography scale (`.title-hero`, `.title-main`, `.overline`, `.body-text`…), built from the confirmed Figma grid and type styles.

### Changed
- SASS custom classes now use Tailwind utilities via `@apply` (typography aligned with the button component); convention documented in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Fixed
- Restored the asset build under webpack 5 — replaced `browser-sync-webpack-plugin@0.1.0` with `@2.4.0` and pinned `browser-sync@3` — so `npm run dev`/`prod` compile again.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- Removed the `dist/ export-ignore` rule inherited from the starter theme's `.gitattributes`. It excluded compiled assets from any git-archive-based deploy (WP Pusher), so `dist/css`/`dist/js` never reached staging/production, leaving the site completely unstyled.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- `button.php` component with the theme's 5 real button types (Primary, Secondary, Black, Arrow Down, Arrow Only), matching exact colors/states from the Figma Design System page.
- `weizenkorn_the_svg_icon()` template tag with the arrow icon set (arrow-right, arrow-down, arrow-download) from Figma.
- Design System preview page (`page-templates/page-design-system.php`), showcasing the button component live.

### Changed
- Documented the project's responsive breakpoint convention in `CLAUDE.md` (desktop = `xl`, tablet = `md`-`xl`, mobile = below `md`).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-22

### Changed
- Replaced placeholder colors and fonts with the real Weizenkorn design tokens from Figma: brand red, dark and cream colors, and DM Sans typography, applied across `_vars.sass`, `tailwind.config.js` and the Google Fonts setup.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- Initial project setup from the dig.id starter theme (v1.13.0).
